React Weather

Example React weather application that uses OpenWeatherMap API to display the weather of cities in the world.

To render the big weather icon (the sun, clouds, etc), we get the icon ID from the OpenWeatherMap API. Next use the prefix 'wi wi-owm-' (got it from the weather icons API compatibility list) to compose the class name that we need. 

Background color is changing depend on tempereture, for example class 'warm' for temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees has color yellow.
